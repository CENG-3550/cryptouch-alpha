# Cryptouch(Demo)
Cryptouch is a communication tool which leverages both blockchain and IPFS distributed system models. It is developed to satisfy the demands of company, society and individual communication. A private blockchain system is planned to be used. The key objectives are:
- Provide its users with their freedom of software philosophy with an intermediate, distributed, open source, secure, transparent and constant communication. 
- item The completion of a user-to-user message, file transfer, video conference and advertising system through the use of emerging technologies like IPFS without mediation. 
- item Providing a continuous, redundant and secure communication environment in the network where the application is used.

It's a demo of Cryptouch. I use Whisper protocol, and use React for backend and frontend of app.

# Whisper Protocol
Ethereum Whisper is developed for the protection of user privacy as a flexible and safe communications system. The protocol follows the idea of "darkness," which is that it obscures the information included in the messages and its sender and recipient details by the observers. By default, asymmetric or symmetric messages are encrypted. Asymmetric encryption utilizes both public and private encryption keys. This type of encryption is used to communicate individually. During the symmetrical encryption process, a single encryption and decryption key facilitates communications one by one. If a participant can be decoded, a message is received. The privately held keys owner can so receive communications for them alone. Anyone with the right symmetric key can receive one-to-many communications. Obviously, the strong relationship with Ethereum makes public/private key pairs feasible for all participants, making this completely encrypted architecture viable.
